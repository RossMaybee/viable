So the project that I've had in mind for a while now to start building it, I'd love to get to use Claude to do this. Is all around the idea of helping people who are preparedness minded. Not just understand what they've done, but get essentially individualized coaching on what they ought to do next and how to prioritize their time, energy and money. My concept for doing so would effectively be something along the lines of like a gamification type platform, right? So let's say that I am concerned about the possibility of civil unrest due to living near D.C. and I'm concerned that we could have disruptions to my neighborhood. Right.  
Me: Individualized function. What they want to do. I'm not currently. Doing this. What effectively? Something along the lines. Of it. Personally.  
Them: I think there's a lot of different ways that you build security for your family, right? And it's not all typical, like, prepper minded. I'm going to move to a compound in the rural mountain area. We can all do that, right? We're all like suburban living moms and dads, right? So how do I properly coach someone to take steps that are effective?  
Me: Securing.  
Them: And how do I scale that coaching. Right. The way that I'm thinking about it is, again, my mind went to gamification. So give somebody a dashboard. Right? If you go back and watch old episodes of Doomsday Preppers on National Geographic.  
Me: Somebody.  
Them: Terrible show. Fun to watch. Terrible show. But at the end, they gave people a composite score. Of what they're prepared for. Everything from water, food, energy, security, finances, et cetera. My idea is, hey, we shouldn't do it exactly like that, but let's think of a framework. Let's give people preparedness scores. Let's suggest to them like, hey, you validated these skills. You haven't actually checked the box on these others. If you tell me you were actually ex good at shooting, have you ever shot a USPSA match? I want you to go shoot one and then upload your scores. Right? We'll do as much as we can to give you actual metrics in areas where we can't. We'll find a way around it. And then on the monetization front, in addition to. Typical ads on a platform like this. I think there's very low hanging fruit opportunities to do a couple more things. One would be sort of a paid upgrade tier where you could help match people. In local areas near each other that have similar values and backgrounds and are preparing for similar things into a mutual assistance group. And I also think, although I think way too many people focus on the stuff rather than the skills, I think that there's some really low hanging fruit to do. Almost like a subscription service, right? You tell us your monthly budget, this is what I spend. And instead of you getting this janky battle box bullshit, which is. Like, here's a compass that isn't actually that good, so you could go do this mission, and it pairs with this signal flare instead. It's like, hey, you got way too many guns. You don't have nearly enough food. Every month, we're gonna take until your stocks are where they ought to. Be. We're gonna send you out of your $100 budget. We're sending you $50 of freeze dried foods and then these additional tools which are tailored to the things you already have and the things you need to go get. Go get. I think that's about it.
