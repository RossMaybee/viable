# Product Requirements Document: Preparedness Coaching Platform

## Executive Summary

A gamified web platform that provides individualized preparedness coaching for suburban families, focusing on practical skills, validated achievements, and personalized recommendations. The platform addresses the gap between generic "prepper" advice and actionable, prioritized guidance tailored to individual circumstances, threat profiles, and resources.

**Target Users**: Preparedness-minded suburban families living in urban/suburban areas (not rural compound dwellers) who want practical, realistic readiness guidance.

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform preparedness from overwhelming to manageable through personalized coaching, skill validation, progress tracking, and intelligent resource allocation.

---

## Product Vision

Help suburban families achieve meaningful emergency preparedness through:
- **Measurement**: Multi-dimensional scoring across critical preparedness categories
- **Validation**: Verified skills and achievements, not just self-reported
- **Guidance**: AI-driven personalized recommendations based on individual threat profiles, budgets, and current status
- **Community**: Connections with like-minded individuals for mutual assistance groups
- **Optimization**: Intelligent resource allocation prioritizing skills over "stuff"

---

## Problem Statement

Current preparedness resources suffer from:
1. **Generic advice** that doesn't account for individual circumstances (location, household size, budget, existing resources)
2. **Overwhelming information** without clear prioritization
3. **Focus on gear over skills** (e.g., subscription boxes with random items vs. filling actual gaps)
4. **No progress tracking** or validation of claimed capabilities
5. **Isolation** - difficulty finding trusted, compatible mutual assistance groups
6. **Poor resource allocation** - people buy redundant items while ignoring critical gaps

### 4. AI-Powered Recommendation Engine

**Purpose**: Provide prioritized, actionable next steps tailored to each user

**Inputs**:
- Current preparedness scores (all categories)
- Threat profile and weighted concerns
- Available budget (one-time and monthly)
- Time availability
- Existing validated skills
- Current inventory
- User preferences and constraints

**Outputs**:
- Top 3-5 "Next Steps" recommendations
- Each recommendation includes:
  - Clear action description
  - Why it's recommended (reasoning/explanation)
  - Estimated time required
  - Estimated cost
  - Difficulty level
  - Expected score impact
  - Alternative options (different price points, methods)

**Examples**:
- "Your water score is low. Priority action: Install 55-gallon water storage barrel ($80, 2 hours setup). This addresses your top concern (civil unrest causing water disruption)."
- "You have security equipment but no validated skills. Action: Register for USPSA match within 50 miles to validate shooting ability."
- "Food stocks are good but all expire within 6 months. Action: Rotate 20% of stock and replace with longer-term freeze-dried options."

**Requirements**:
- Integration with Claude or similar LLM for generating personalized coaching insights
- Algorithm must balance:
  - Urgency (biggest gaps)
  - Feasibility (within budget/time)
  - Dependencies (prerequisites)
  - User preferences
