# Backend Architecture for Preparedness Platform

## Platform Overview
A gamified preparedness coaching platform that provides individualized guidance, skill validation, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations for suburban families focused on practical emergency preparedness.

## Core Backend Requirements

### 1. User Management & Authentication
- **User registration/login system** with secure authentication (JWT/OAuth)
- **User profiles** storing:
  - Demographics and location data
  - Preparedness goals and threat concerns
  - Skill validations and certifications
  - Resource inventory (gear, supplies, skills)
  - Budget preferences for subscriptions
- **Role-based access control** (free tier, premium tier, admin)

### 2. Scoring & Assessment Engine
- **Multi-dimensional scoring system** across categories:
  - Water preparedness
  - Food storage
  - Energy/power
  - Security
  - Medical supplies
  - Communications
  - Financial preparedness
  - Skills & training
- **Composite score calculation** algorithm
- **Real-time score updates** as users complete tasks/validations
- **Historical score tracking** for progress visualization

### 3. Skills Validation System
- **Skill registry** with verification criteria
- **Evidence upload system** for:
  - Competition scores (USPSA, etc.)
  - Certifications/diplomas
  - Photos/videos of completed tasks
  - Third-party API integrations (shooting sports platforms, training organizations)
- **Validation workflow** (auto-verify vs manual review)
- **Achievement/badge system**

### 4. Recommendation Engine (AI/ML)
- **Personalization algorithm** considering:
  - Current preparedness scores
  - User location and threat profile
  - Budget constraints
  - Existing resources/skills
  - Time availability
- **Priority queue system** for suggested next actions
- **Task recommendation API** with reasoning/explanation
- **Integration with Claude/LLM** for coaching insights

### 5. Inventory Management
- **Resource tracking database** for user-owned items:
  - Equipment and gear
  - Food supplies (with expiration tracking)
  - Ammunition/defensive tools
  - Medical supplies
- **Gap analysis engine** comparing current vs recommended inventory
- **Expiration alerts and notifications**

### 6. Subscription Box Service
- **Budget allocation algorithm**
  - Analyzes gaps in user's preparedness
  - Prioritizes spending across categories
  - Generates monthly shipment contents
- **Product catalog database** with:
  - Item specifications
  - Pricing
  - Compatibility/dependency mapping
  - Vendor information
- **Order management system**
- **Inventory deduction** (update user inventory post-shipment)
- **Payment processing** (Stripe/payment gateway integration)
- **Shipping integration** with fulfillment partners

### 7. Mutual Assistance Group (MAG) Matching
- **Geographic proximity search** (geospatial queries)
- **Compatibility scoring** based on:
  - Values/beliefs alignment
  - Threat scenarios
  - Skill complementarity
  - Preparedness levels
- **Privacy controls** (gradual information disclosure)
- **Group formation tools**:
  - Messaging system
  - Group dashboards
  - Shared resource tracking
  - Meeting coordination
- **Verification/vetting workflow** for safety

### 8. Content & Knowledge Base
- **Educational content management**
- **Tutorial/guide database** linked to skills
- **Threat scenario library** with recommended preparations
- **Dynamic content delivery** based on user profile

### 9. Monetization Infrastructure
- **Subscription management** (free/premium tiers)
- **Payment processing** for recurring and one-time charges
- **Ad serving integration** for free tier
- **Referral/affiliate tracking** for product recommendations
- **Usage analytics** for pricing optimization

### 10. Analytics & Reporting
- **User behavior tracking**
- **Engagement metrics** (completion rates, time-to-completion)
- **Conversion funnel analysis** (free â†’ premium)
- **A/B testing framework** for recommendations
- **Admin dashboards** for platform health monitoring

## Technical Stack Considerations

### Database Architecture
- **Primary database**: PostgreSQL for relational data (users, scores, inventory)
- **Document store**: MongoDB/DynamoDB for flexible schema data (skill validations, evidence)
- **Geospatial**: PostGIS extension for MAG matching
- **Cache layer**: Redis for session management, score calculations, real-time features
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for product catalog, content discovery

### APIs & Services
- **RESTful API** for client applications
- **GraphQL layer** for flexible data querying
- **WebSocket support** for real-time updates (score changes, notifications)
- **Microservices architecture**:
  - User service
  - Scoring service
  - Recommendation service
  - Inventory service
  - Subscription/fulfillment service
  - Matching service
  - Payment service

### External Integrations
- **LLM API** (Claude/OpenAI) for coaching and recommendations
- **Payment gateway** (Stripe)
- **Shipping APIs** (ShipStation, EasyPost)
- **Email/SMS** (SendGrid, Twilio) for notifications
- **Cloud storage** (S3) for user uploads
- **Sports/certification APIs** for automatic validation

### Security & Compliance
- **Data encryption** at rest and in transit
- **PII protection** especially for location data
- **GDPR/CCPA compliance** mechanisms
- **Secure file upload** with virus scanning
- **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection
- **Audit logging** for sensitive operations

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal scaling** for API servers
- **Load balancing** (AWS ELB, Nginx)
- **CDN** for static content and media
- **Background job processing** (RabbitMQ/Celery) for:
  - Score recalculation
  - Recommendation generation
  - Email notifications
  - Batch operations
- **Database replication** and sharding strategy
